# Project1-Interneuron

You are to model an interneuron reported in Kim et al. (2013). For this, you will use the package NEURON. As a first step, peruse the paper by Kim et al. (2013) that has a complete description of the model and make sure you understand all the biological properties modeled. 

Then read the instructions in the FS Interneuron Model.docx file to complete the project.
